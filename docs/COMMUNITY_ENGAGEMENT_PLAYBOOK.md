# Community Engagement & Copywriting Guide

## 1. Reddit Strategy (The "Value-First" Post)
*   **Subreddit:** r/freelance
*   **Headline:** I built an AI tool because I was tired of spending 4 hours a week looking for `final_v2_edit.mov`.
*   **Body:** Focus on the pain point. Don't sell. Ask for feedback. "I'm a video editor and my drive is a mess. I used CLIP embeddings to make my files searchable by 'mood' and 'color' instead of names. Does anyone else need this?"

## 2. Twitter/X Growth Hook
*   **Thread Idea:** "10 ways AI is saving me 10+ hours of admin work as a solo creator. 🧵"
*   **Hook:** "Most creators are organized. Until they have 10,000 assets. Then the chaos starts. Here is how I used [Creator Asset AI] to automate my entire library."

## 3. Brand Tone & Voice
*   **Persona:** The Sophisticated Assistant. 
*   **Traits:** Efficient, invisible, supportive, tech-forward but artistically minded.
*   **Avoid:** Corporate jargon, "Synergy", "Optimization" (use "More time for art" instead).
