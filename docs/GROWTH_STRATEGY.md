# Growth Hack Strategy: "The Great Migration" Campaign

## 1. Core Narrative
"Stop the Digital Archeology." Most freelancers spend 20% of their time looking for files. We position Creator Asset AI as the tool that gives them back one full day per week.

## 2. Target Communities (The Watering Holes)
*   **Designers:** r/GraphicDesign, Behance, Dribbble, Figma Community.
*   **Video Editors:** r/VideoEditing, CreativeCOW, Discord (Editor’s Lounge).
*   **Photographers:** r/Photography, Pexels/Unsplash contributors.

## 3. Growth Loops (Viral Mechanics)
*   **The "Storage Bounty":** Users get 5GB of additional AI-processing credits for every successful referral.
*   **Public Asset Showcases:** Creators can create a "Smart Portfolio" link where assets are automatically tagged and searchable by clients. The footer of these portfolios includes: "Powered by Creator Asset AI - Organize your chaos."
*   **Side-Project Marketing:** "The File Name Horror Gallery" — A microsite where users submit their worst file names (e.g., `final_v2_USE_THIS_ONE_REAL_FINAL.psd`) to win a lifetime subscription.

## 4. Influencer Seed Strategy
*   **Micro-Influencers (Tier 3):** Reach out to 50 YouTubers who do "Desk Setup" or "Workflow" videos. Provide them with a white-labeled version of the "Second Brain" to show off their organized library.
