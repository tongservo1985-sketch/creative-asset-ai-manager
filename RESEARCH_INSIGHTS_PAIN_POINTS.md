# UX Research Insights: The "Why" behind the Flows

## Core Friction Points Identified
1.  **The "Naming Burden":** Creators hate naming files. Our flow prioritizes **Visual Indexing** over filenames.
2.  **Context Switching:** Moving from Photoshop to a file browser breaks "Flow State." Our journey emphasizes **In-App Retrieval**.
3.  **Fear of Loss:** Users are afraid AI will "move" their files and they won't find them.
    *   *Solution:* We use a "Virtual Library" approach where the physical file stays safe, but the AI view is organized.

## Success Metrics for User Flows
*   **Time-to-Asset:** Reduction in seconds from "Thought" to "File Opened."
*   **Zero-Tag Ratio:** Percentage of files successfully organized without user-typed metadata.
*   **Organization Confidence:** User survey score on "How much do you trust the system to find an old file?"
